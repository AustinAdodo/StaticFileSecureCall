##### NB : Elastic Beanstalk sets the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to Production when your application is deployed to a production environment.
##### We have added LinqKit.EntityFramework to enhance functionalities of entity framework Queries.
##### NB: The Dbset should never be referenced from the namespace System.Data.Entity as this may lead to Error "Only sources that implement IDbAsyncEnumerable can be used for Entity Framework asynchronous operations"
##### Generic DBSets&ltTEntity&gt should only reference Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore namespace.
